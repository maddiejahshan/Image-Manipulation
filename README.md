# Image-Manipulation
This program allows an image to be altered in several different ways by methods including blur, 
grayscale filter, sephia filter, negative filter, edge detection, vertical flip, vertical mirror, and the
isolation of a single color of an image. The images are displayed in a 3 by 3 grid with the original in the center.

Each cell will print the edited image alongside the original image. To see all eight versions, run the last cell in the program and allow 45 to 60 seconds of run time. Thank you!
